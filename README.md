# TestMyGamepad - Documentation & User Guide

Welcome to the official documentation hub for **TestMyGamepad**. This repository outlines the technical specifications, testing methodologies, and calibration protocols used in our browser-based utilities.

## 🚀 About the Tool
[TestMyGamepad](https://testmygamepad.com) is a web-based utility designed to provide gamers with accurate, real-time analysis of their controller's performance. Unlike standard input testers, our engine visualizes complex data points including:

*   **Stick Drift Analysis:** Visualizes the centering error of analog sticks.
*   **Polling Rate Check:** Measures the Hz frequency of data reports (Bluetooth vs. Wired).
*   **Input Latency:** Estimates the delay between physical actuation and browser registration.

## 🛠 Features & Modules

### 1. Calibration Tool
Our core utility allows users to [check controller drift](https://testmygamepad.com/calibration.html) and circularity errors. It supports:
*   Sony DualSense / DualShock 4
*   Xbox Series X|S / Elite
*   Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons & Pro Controller
*   Generic DirectInput Gamepads

### 2. Performance Guides
We maintain technical documentation on maximizing hardware efficiency:
*   **Overclocking:** Reducing input lag on PC.
*   **Hall Effect Upgrades:** Comparing magnetic sensors vs. traditional potentiometers.

### 3. Repair Database
A structured library of hardware fixes for common faults:
*   **Drift Repair:** Cleaning potentiometers and soldering replacements.
*   **Tactile Fixes:** Resolving bumper inconsistency and sticky buttons.
